/**
 * 数据来源spout<br>
 * Desc: spout essentially emits a stream containing 1 of 2 sentences 'Other
 * Random Word' or 'Hello World' based on random probability. It works by
 * generating a random number upon construction and then generating subsequent
 * random numbers to test against the original member variable's value. When it
 * matches "Hello World" is emitted, during the remaining executions the other
 * sentence is emitted.
